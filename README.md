# ExceptionError_Intf
Exception & Error Interface 
A standardized interface for handling exceptions and errors across applications. This repository provides a clear, consistent, and extensible contract for creating custom exception classes, ensuring uniform error handling logic.

üåü Overview
Handling errors is a critical part of building robust software. However, without a consistent approach, error handling logic can become messy, duplicated, and hard to maintain. ExceptionError_Intf solves this by providing a simple yet powerful interface that forces a standardized structure for all custom exceptions in your project.

This ensures that whether you're dealing with a database connection error, an invalid API input, or a business logic failure, the way you throw, catch, and inspect the error remains the same.

‚ú® Features
Standardized Contract: A clear and simple interface for creating custom exceptions.

Rich Error Information: Enforces the inclusion of essential details like error codes, messages, and optional payloads.

Extensible: Easily extend the base interface to create more specific exception types for different modules (e.g., DatabaseException, ApiException).

Improved Readability: Makes the application's error handling logic predictable and easy to understand.

Framework Agnostic: Can be used with any framework.
